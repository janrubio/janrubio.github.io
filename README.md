# janrub.io

Static site built on top of [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole).

## Development

### 1. Install Jekyll

Poole is built for use with Jekyll, so naturally you'll need to install that. On Macs, it's rather straightforward:

```bash
$ gem install jekyll
```

### 2. Running locally

To see your Jekyll site with Poole applied, start a Jekyll server. In Terminal, from `/Poole` (or whatever your Jekyll site's root directory is named):

```bash
$ jekyll serve --watch
```
